# üöÄ Real-Time Fraud Transaction Detection Pipeline

This repository contains the code for an end-to-end machine learning project designed to detect fraudulent financial transactions in real-time. The project progresses from in-depth exploratory data analysis and advanced feature engineering to hyperparameter tuning of an XGBoost model and its deployment as an interactive web application.

The final model is deployed using Streamlit and can be accessed via the live demo link below.

### üìà **Model Performance**

After extensive feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning, the final **XGBoost** model demonstrated excellent performance on the unseen test set:

-   ‚úÖ **ROC-AUC Score:** **0.9995**, indicating an outstanding ability to distinguish between fraudulent and legitimate transactions.
-   ‚úÖ **Precision-Recall AUC:** **0.9445**, confirming strong performance on the highly imbalanced dataset.
-   At the optimal threshold of **0.97**, the model achieved a high **F1-Score of 0.89**, successfully balancing the need to catch fraud (Recall) while minimizing false alarms (Precision).

### üß† **Model Interpretability with SHAP**

To ensure the model's decisions are transparent, I used **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** to interpret the model's predictions.

#### üîë **Key Insights:**
-   **Recent Fraud History:** The most powerful predictors were features tracking recent fraudulent activity on a customer's account (`customer_fraud_rolling_7d`) and at a specific terminal (`terminal_fraud_28d`).
-   **Transaction Amount:** The `TX_AMOUNT` was also a major contributor, with higher values strongly indicating a higher risk of fraud.
-   These insights confirm that the model learns patterns that align with real-world fraud scenarios, increasing trust in its predictions.

### üîß **How to Run Locally**

#### 1. Clone the Repository
Open your terminal and run the following command:

git clone [https://github.com/your-username/Fraud-Transaction-Detection-Pipeline.git](https://github.com/your-username/Fraud-Transaction-Detection-Pipeline.git)
cd Fraud-Transaction-Detection-Pipeline

2. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
It's best practice to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

# For Windows
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate

# For macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

3. Install Dependencies
Install all the required libraries using the requirements.txt file.
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the Streamlit App
Launch the web application by running:
streamlit run app.py

After running the command, Streamlit will provide a local URL (like http://localhost:8501) that you can open in your browser to use the dashboard.

üôå Closing Thoughts
This project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to solving a critical financial problem using machine learning. By building a highly accurate and interpretable model, this pipeline showcases the potential of AI to create robust systems that can enhance security and build trust in digital transactions. While not a production-ready system, it serves as a strong proof-of-concept for data-driven fraud detection.
